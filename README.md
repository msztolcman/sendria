Sendria (formerly MailTrap) is a SMTP server designed to run in your dev/test environment, catch any email you
or your application is sending, and display it in a web interface instead of sending to real world.
It help you prevent sending any dev/test emails to real people, no matter what address you provide.
Just point your app/email client to `smtp://127.0.0.1:1025` and look at your emails on `http://127.0.0.1:1080`.

Sendria is built on shoulders of:
* [MailCatcher](https://mailcatcher.me/) - original idea comes of this tool by Samuel Cochran.
* [MailDump](https://github.com/ThiefMaster/maildump) - base source code of `Sendria` (version pre 1.0.0), by Adrian Mönnich.

If you like this tool, just [say thanks](https://saythanks.io/to/marcin%40urzenia.net).

Current stable version
----------------------

2.2.2

Installation
------------

`Sendria` should work on any POSIX platform where [Python](http://python.org)
is available, it means Linux, MacOS/OSX etc.

Simplest way is to use Python's built-in package system:

    python3 -m pip install sendria

You can also use [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/) if you don't want to
mess with system packages and install `Sendria` in virtual environment:

    pipx install sendria

Voila!

Python version
--------------

`Sendria` is tested against Python 3.7+. Older Python versions may work, or may not.

If you want to run this software on Python 2.6+, just use [MailDump](https://github.com/ThiefMaster/maildump).

How to use
----------

[After installing](#installation) `Sendria` just run command:

    sendria --db mails.sqlite

Now send emails through `smtp://127.0.0.1:1025`, i.e.:

```shell
echo 'From: Sendria <sendria@example.com>\n'\
'To: You <you@example.com>\n'\
'Subject: Welcome!\n\n'\
'Welcome to Sendria!' | \
  curl smtp://localhost:1025 --mail-from sendria@example.com \
    --mail-rcpt you@example.com --upload-file -
```

or simpler with [SMTPc](https://github.com/msztolcman/smtpc/):

```shell
smtpc send --host localhost:1025 --from sendria@example.com --to you@example.com \
  --subject 'Welcome!' --body 'Welcome to Sendria!'
```

Finally, look at `Sendria` GUI on [127.0.0.1:1080](http://127.0.0.1:1080).

If you want more details, run:

    sendria --help

for more info, ie. how to protect access to gui.


API
---

`Sendria` offers RESTful API you can use to fetch list of messages or particular message, ie. for testing purposes.

You can use excellent [httpie](https://httpie.org/) tool:

```shell
% http localhost:1080/api/messages/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 620
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Wed, 22 Jul 2020 20:04:46 GMT
Server: Sendria/2.2.2 (https://sendria.net)

{
    "code": "OK",
    "data": [
        {
            "created_at": "2020-07-22T20:04:41",
            "id": 1,
            "peer": "127.0.0.1:59872",
            "recipients_envelope": [
                "you@example.com"
            ],
            "recipients_message_bcc": [],
            "recipients_message_cc": [],
            "recipients_message_to": [
                "You <you@exampl.com>"
            ],
            "sender_envelope": "sendria@example.com",
            "sender_message": "Sendria <sendria@example.com>",
            "size": 191,
            "source": "From: Sendria <sendria@example.com>\nTo: You <you@exampl.com>\nSubject: Welcome!\nX-Peer: ('127.0.0.1', 59872)\nX-MailFrom: sendria@example.com\nX-RcptTo: you@example.com\n\nWelcome to Sendria!\n",
            "subject": "Welcome!",
            "type": "text/plain"
        }
    ],
    "meta": {
        "pages_total": 3
    }
}
```

There are available endpoints:

* `GET /api/messages/` - fetch list of emails. There is one query string param: `page` for pagination.
* `DELETE /api/messages/` - delete all emails
* `GET /api/messages/{message_id}.json` - fetch email metadata
* `GET /api/messages/{message_id}.plain` - fetch plain part of email
* `GET /api/messages/{message_id}.html` - fetch HTML part of email
* `GET /api/messages/{message_id}.source` - fetch source of email
* `GET /api/messages/{message_id}.eml` - download whole email as an EML file
* `GET /api/messages/{message_id}/parts/{cid}` - download particular attachment
* `DELETE /api/messages/{message_id}` - delete single email

Docker
------

There is also available [Docker image of Sendria](https://hub.docker.com/r/msztolcman/sendria).
If you want to try, just run:

```shell
docker run -p 1025:1025 -p 1080:1080 msztolcman/sendria:v2.2.2.0
```

Help!
-----

I'm backend developer, not a frontend guy nor designer... If you are, and want to help, just [mail me!](mailto:marcin@urzenia.net).
I think GUI should be redesigned, or at least few minor issues could be solved. Also, project requires some logo and/or icon. Again,
do not hesitate to [mail me](mailto:marcin@urzenia.net) if you want and can help :)

Also, if you have an idea how to enhance `Sendria`, [please fill the ticket](https://github.com/msztolcman/sendria/issues).
Every idea, every feature request can help you, me and others!

Configure Rails
---------------

For your rails application just set in your `environments/development.rb`:

    config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
    config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = { :address => '127.0.0.1', :port => 1025 }
    config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = false

Configure Django
----------------

To configure Django to work with `Sendria`, add the following to your projects' `settings.py`:

    if DEBUG:
        EMAIL_HOST = '127.0.0.1'
        EMAIL_HOST_USER = ''
        EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = ''
        EMAIL_PORT = 1025
        EMAIL_USE_TLS = False

Configure Laravel
----------------

To use `Sendria` in a Laravel project, configure your `.env` file as follow:

    MAIL_DRIVER=smtp
    MAIL_HOST=127.0.0.1
    MAIL_PORT=1025
    MAIL_USERNAME=
    MAIL_PASSWORD=
    MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tcp
    MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your@domain.com

As Sendria does not support TLS or SSL, it's very important to specify `MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tcp` (instead of the default `MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null`),
otherwise you will get a `Swift_TransportException` (with error `stream_socket_client(): unable to connect to null://127.0.0.1`).

Behind nginx
------------

If you want to hide `Sendria` behind nginx (ie. to terminate ssl) then you can [use example
config (see in addons)](https://github.com/msztolcman/sendria/tree/master/addons/nginx.conf).

Supervisord
-----------

To start `Sendria` automatically with [Supervisor](https://supervisord.org/) there is in
[addons example config file for this purpose](https://github.com/msztolcman/sendria/tree/master/addons/supervisor.conf).
